Experimental reactive programming framework for C++.

I've only tested the build with Visual Studio 2012 and the Intel C++ Compiler 14.0.

Intel TBB 4.2 is a required dependency (https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/).
To compile and run the unit tests, the Google test framework is required (https://code.google.com/p/googletest/).
