Experimental reactive programming framework for C++11.

I've only tested the build with Visual Studio 2012 and the Intel C++ Compiler 14.0.

[Intel TBB 4.2](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) is a required dependency.
To compile and run the unit tests, the [Google test framework](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) is required.

License/documentation will be added in the future.

[See here](https://github.com/schlangster/cpp.react/blob/master/src/sandbox/Main.cpp) for some usage examples.
